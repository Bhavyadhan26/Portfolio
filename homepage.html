        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a strong foundation in both backend and frontend development. Currently in my third year of studies, I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world projects. I have a keen interest in data security and have explored various technologies in the fields of IoT and data analysis. In my journey, Iâ€™ve developed applications that are both scalable and user-centric, such as a smart chair for posture improvement and a scalable attendance system. I believe in the power of continuous learning and strive to keep myself updated with the latest trends in technology. Apart from coding, I enjoy collaborating on creative solutions, volunteering for initiatives, and attending tech events that help me stay ahead in this ever-evolving industry.</p>
